/* k3_run.c - run the REAL Kimi K3, all 93 layers, from the released checkpoint.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS
 *   The full engine: safetensors index over 96 shards, resident trunk bound by name,
 *   routed experts streamed from disk through an LRU cache and multiplied straight out
 *   of MXFP4. Greedy decode. Token ids in, token ids out.
 *
 * MEMORY. The banner this program prints before allocating is a PLAN, not a measurement.
 *   It reports requested budgets rather than actual reservations, and in practice it
 *   OVERSTATES: across the 12-rung ladder in docs/data/ the planned total exceeded
 *   measured peak RSS by 0.13-1.84 GB, because both budgets round down to whole slots and
 *   that rounding outweighs the safetensors index it omits. Quote the "PEAK RSS" line
 *   instead, which comes from
 *   getrusage after the run. Fully resident, the weights are 108.81 GB of bf16 trunk plus
 *   4.70 GB of embed and lm_head, so 113.49 GB; streamed, the resident set is whatever
 *   budget is given, down to about 8.2 GB. The 1.45 TB of routed experts is never
 *   resident at any budget.
 *
 * THIS ENGINE IS I/O BOUND at small budgets and roughly balanced at large ones. The
 *   measured I/O share runs 40.9%-60.6% across the 12-rung ladder (docs/data/), dropping
 *   below 50% at 96 GB and above. The "I/O share" line printed at the end of every run
 *   reports it for that run. Going faster still means moving fewer bytes before it means
 *   computing less, which is why docs/TUNING.md is mostly about allocation.
 *
 * DECODE STRATEGY
 *   By default each step re-runs the whole prefix rather than carrying state forward.
 *   That is O(T^2), but it is the path the full-model oracle validates in
 *   tests/unit/k3_model.c. --incremental switches to prefill-then-one-token-at-a-time,
 *   carrying the KDA recurrent state and an MLA KV cache. GATE 3 of the tiny-model
 *   oracle requires it to produce the SAME tokens as full recompute, so the equivalence
 *   is tested rather than assumed. Context is limited by the MLA KV cache
 *   (~2.37 MB/position), not by array sizes; the engine computes the requirement up
 *   front and refuses the run if it will not fit.
 *
 * COMMAND LINE
 *   usage() below is the single source of truth for options and defaults; `k3 --help`
 *   prints it. It is not duplicated here, because a second copy is a second thing to
 *   keep correct and the copy is the one that goes stale.

 * rows. The AttnRes block buffer is NOT carried because forward() clears it on entry and
 * rebuilds it from the layer outputs every pass; saving it would be saving scratch.
 *
 * The KV cache is stored position-major inside each MLA layer's slice, so only the
 * OCCUPIED positions are written and a resumed run may size its cache differently. The
 * header carries a config fingerprint: restoring state built by a different architecture
 * would produce fluent, wrong output with nothing to indicate it, which is the one

 * One sequence, appended in order: a decode must start at the cached length (or at 0,
 * which resets). The KDA/ShortConv state is not positional, so truncating into the
 * middle restores the latest checkpoint at or before the cut and replays the tokens up
 * to it; checkpoints are taken after every multi-token batch (prompt ends: the point a
 * chat turn's re-rendered prompt diverges from what was generated). min_pos is the
 * oldest position a truncation can reach, reported so front ends do not ask for less.
 * With --dspark, a one-token decode at the end also drafts a block and verifies it in
 * the same sweep; the accepted tokens' logits are held, and a following decode of
 * exactly that token at that position is answered from them without a forward. The
